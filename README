Websockets for NaviServer
=========================
Release 0.1

This is a NaviServer module that implements websockets for NaviServer
and provides an API for for it. The websockets are integrated in
NaviServer using the ns_chan command, which will be part version
4.99.7 of NaviServer.

Connections are established via ws::handshake, which is typically
initiated via JavaScript. Common libraries such as jQueries provided
support for websockets. The command ws::handshake returns a handle for
the connection channel, which can be used for further
configuration. The handle has to be used for all other operations on
the websocket, such as sending data to a single channel, or for
subscribing / unsubscribing the channel from a subscription.

The package contains two same websocket applications

* chat: A simple chat application with the mere purpose to provide an
  example how to use websockets
  
* log-view: A websocket application that allows live viewing of log
  contents. It uses on a tcl-based "tail -f" like command that watches
  certain files (e.g. access.log, or error.log) and reports recent
  changes to the subscribed clients.

By default, the sample applications are deactivated. See below in the
configuration section how to activate the sample applications.

The implementation is based on nsf, which is available from e.g.
http://next-scripting.org/
    
***

Configuration:
--------------

In order to configure websockets, add the following lines to the
config file of NaviServer. The section module/websocket/$appname is
optional and allows to configure the named websocket applications.

When the section module/websocket/$appname is missing, or the "urls"
parameter is empty, then the application is deactivated.  Via the urls
parameters, multiple urls can be specified, under which the websocket
applications are available. This way, one can e.g. define multiple
chats with different subscriber lists.

Be aware that the log-viewer might reveal internal information, so be
careful when registering it on public sites. In the example below, we
provide it under "/admin/", which is restricted for OpenACS to site
wide administrators.

    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/modules"
       ns_param websocket tcl

    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/websocket/chat"
       ns_param urls     /websocket/chat

    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/websocket/log-view"
       ns_param urls     /admin/websocket/log-view
       ns_param refresh  1000   ;# refresh time for file watcher in milliseconds

Installation:
-------------

    make install


Usage:
------

The provided websockt API consists of the the following commands:

    ws::build_msg ?-opcode /value/? /payload/
    ws::decode_msg /channel/ /msg/
    ws::handshake ?-readevent /boolean/? ?-callback /script/?
    ws::log /msg/
    ws::multicast ?-exclude /value/? /subscription/ /msg/
    ws::readable /channel/ /callback/ /when/
    ws::send /channel/ /msg/
    ws::subscribe /channel/ /subscription/
    ws::unsubscribe /channel/ /subscription/

See the example websocket applications for usage patterns.
