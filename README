WebSockets for NaviServer
=========================
Release 0.3

This is a NaviServer module that implements WebSockets for NaviServer
and provides an API for it. The WebSockets are integrated in
NaviServer using the ns_chan command. The current implementation
requires NaviServer 4.99.20 or newer.

Connections are established via ws::handshake, which is typically
initiated via JavaScript. Common libraries such as jQueries provided
support for WebSockets.

The WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455) defines a ws:// and wss:// prefix to
indicate a WebSocket or a WebSocket Secure connection. Both schemes
use the HTTP upgrade mechanism to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol.
For WebSocket Secure connection, the NaviServer module nsssl has to be
installed and configured.  For incoming HTTP/HTTPS connections the
upgrade is provided via the command ws::handshake, which returns a
handle for the connection channel. This handle has to be used for all
other operations on the WebSocket, such as sending data to a single
channel, or for subscribing / unsubscribing the channel from a
subscription. The API provides means for encoding and decoding
websocket messages and to send messages as single- or multi-casts
using a subscriber interface.x

The package contains two sample WebSocket applications:

* chat: A simple chat application with the mere purpose to provide an
  example how to use WebSockets
  
* log-view: A WebSocket application that allows live viewing of log
  contents. It uses on a tcl-based "tail -f" like command that watches
  certain files (e.g. access.log, or error.log) and reports recent
  changes to the subscribed clients.

By default, the sample applications are deactivated. See below in the
configuration section how to activate the sample applications.

The implementation is based on nsf, which is available from e.g.
http://next-scripting.org/
    
***

Configuration:
--------------

In order to configure WebSockets, add the following lines to the
config file of NaviServer. The section module/websocket/$appname is
optional and allows one to configure the named websocket applications.

When the section module/websocket/$appname is missing, or the "urls"
parameter is empty, then the application is deactivated.  Via the urls
parameters, multiple urls can be specified, under which the WebSocket
applications are available. This way, one can e.g. define multiple
chats with different subscriber lists.

Be aware that the log-viewer might reveal internal information, so be
careful when registering it on public sites. In the example below, we
provide it under "/admin/", which is restricted for OpenACS to site
wide administrators.

    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/modules" {
       ns_param websocket tcl
    }
    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/websocket/chat" {
       ns_param urls     /websocket/chat
    }
    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/websocket/log-view" {
       ns_param urls     /admin/websocket/log-view
       ns_param refresh  1000   ;# refresh time for file watcher in milliseconds
    }


Installation:
-------------

    make install


Usage:
------

The provided WebSocket server API consists of the following commands:

    ws::handshake ?-readevent /boolean/? ?-callback /script/?
    ws::log /msg/
    ws::multicast ?-exclude /value/? /subscription/ /msg/
    ws::io /channel/ /callback/ /when/
    ws::send /channel/ /msg/
    ws::subscribe /channel/ /subscription/
    ws::unsubscribe /channel/ /subscription/

The provided WebSocket client API consists of the following commands:

    ws::client::open /websocketurl/
    ws::client::send /channel/ /textmessage/
    ws::client::receive /channel/
    ws::client::close /channel/

See the included example WebSocket server applications for usage patterns.
